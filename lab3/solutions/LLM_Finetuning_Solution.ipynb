The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n",

Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model. Synthetic data generation and synthetic tasks are a way to address these limitations, and this is an active area of research.\n",

In this lab, we will use a technique called [LLM as a judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) to do exactly this. This involves using a larger LLM to score the outputs of a smaller LLM. The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing."
